We have been anticipating <a href="http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/536130/20140128/android-4-3-5-major-bug-fixes.htm">Android 4.4.3</a>for a while now, but today could finally be the day that it starts rolling.

The builds are KTU84M (Nexus 5) and KTU84L (Nexus 7 2013) and include many bug fixes. The changelog isn’t posted, but we suspect that <a href="http://www.androidphonesoft.com">AndroidPhoneSoft</a> will include fixes to the camera, Wi-Fi issues, and numerous other annoying bugs.</p>
